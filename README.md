# AUTO-Image-Gallery
Creates thumbnails and an image gallery automatically from images uploaded into the same directory <br>

<br><br>

Upload the 4 files:<br>
'index.php', 'imagesdirect.php', 'snakebeings.css', 'inc image reader.php'<br><br>
and one optional file called 'text.txt' where you can add a description to appear at the top of the images <br>


+create a directory called 'images'<br>
++upload your images  and the file "load.php"<br>

Currently the operation is only semi-automatic<br>
it still requires an opperator to press the 'load images' link at the bottom of the page to create the thumbnails- if you have a lot of images you may need to open that link in a few new tabs to populate the thumbnails. Only images with created thumbnails will appear in the gallery.
